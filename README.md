# insta-image-download-helper
Chrome extension that makes it easier to save images from Instagram.

Normally, to download an image from Instagram (without taking a screenshot), you need to use the browser dev tools in order to get the image URL and proceed to download. That gets annoying really quickly...  
So I made this extension that allows you to download the image like you normally would any image from a browser: by right clicking, selecting "save as..." and downloading to your computer.  

## To use it:
1. Download the code
2. Extract the files to a folder
3. Open chrome, go to settings, then click "Extensions"
4. Click "Load unpacked", then select the folder "InstagramImageDownloadHelper".

Once the extension is loaded, go to Instagram, click the puzzle icon in the top right corner of Chrome, and select the new Instagram extension, you will see a button that says "Activate image download helper." Click that.

### You can now click on a post and download its images simply by right clicking and saving!
###### You need to click the activation button once per Instagram session (every time you load Instagram)
